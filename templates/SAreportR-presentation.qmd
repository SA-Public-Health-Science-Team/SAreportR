# Introduction

## Literate Programming

> Literate programming is a methodology that combines a programming language with a documentation ("natural") language.

--- Donald E. Knuth

## SAreportR

-   An SA-developed R package with custom functions and report templates
-   Serves as an app to automatically generate several types of response-related documents in various output formats
-   Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for end-users to specify criteria before generating documents

## Technologies

The key tools used to implement this workflow are:

-   R / Python
-   Quarto / Rmarkdown
-   R Shiny

Other technologies working under the hood include:

-   C++
-   JavaScript
-   HTML/CSS
-   LaTeX

# Workflow

## Components of SAreportR

-   Shiny Dashboard
-   Templates
-   Functions
-   Documentation

# Front-end

## Dashboard

-   R Shiny
-   Allows users to:
    -   select which documents to generate

    -   select the parameters of each document

# Back-end

## Quarto / Rmarkdown Templates

## Functions

-   Main Functions
    -   included in Quarto / Rmarkdown Templates

    -   used to process data sets, create plots, format and output tables, etc.
-   Utility Functions
    -   included within main functions

    -   used to format columns, add calculated columns, scale plots, etc.

# Documentation

## Documentation

-   Function documentation

    -   Can be accessed two ways

        -   within the IDE (RStudio)

        -   via pkgdown site

-   Document SOPs

# Implications for Current Workflow

## Shifts in Current Workflow

-   Compiling reports -\> SDLC (features, bugs, performance, unit testing, etc.)

-   Screen shots AND Power BI -\> R (ggplot/highcharteR)

-   Copy & paste AND Excel -\> R (flextable/gt)

-   OneDrive/SharePoint -\> Git (GitHub/GitLab)

# End
